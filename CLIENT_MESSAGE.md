**Subject:** Alerta Madeira – Project delivery (status & next steps)

Hi,

Here is the first delivery for the **Alerta Madeira** app.

What is included in this delivery:
- The full project source code for the mobile app.
- A short status document describing what has been implemented and how the app works.
- Technical notes on how to install dependencies and build the Android app.

The app’s main features are implemented:
- Authentication and user accounts
- Occurrences (creation and listing)
- Op. Stop section
- Anomalies section
- Lost & found (perdidos)
- Push notifications (Supabase + Expo)
- Admin panel
- User profile

At the moment I am finalizing the **Android build (APK)**. There was a configuration issue that caused the app to crash when opening, and I have been working through that and updating the build setup. A new APK build is being generated and tested now.

**Next step:** As soon as the APK is confirmed stable on a real device, I will send you the download link (or the file) so you can install the app and test all the flows directly on your phone.

If you prefer, you can already review the code and the status document in this delivery. After you test the APK, we can collect any final feedback and apply small adjustments if needed.

Best regards,

[Your name]
